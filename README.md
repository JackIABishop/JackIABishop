# Hey there, I'm Jack 👋

## 🔐 Why You Don’t See Much Here

Due to the classified nature of Aerospace & Defence work, most of my contributions are not publicly visible or hosted on GitHub.  
Much of what I build lives behind firewalls and within internal platforms — but a lot is happening behind the scenes!
