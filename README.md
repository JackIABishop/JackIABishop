## Hey there, I'm Jack 👋
I'm a Senior Engineer currently working in the Aerospace Industry developing functional concepts for future iterations of aircraft. I have a Software Engineering Degree at the **University of Central Lancashire** and a member of the **IET**. 

### What I'm focusing on 🔭
Currently focusing on my career in Aerospace & Defence, so not much commits going on here; but a lot is happening elsewhere.
